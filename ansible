**Ansible from Scratch - Beginner Guide**

---

**🛠️ What is Ansible?**

Ansible is an open-source IT automation tool. It helps you:

* Configure systems (install packages, change settings)
* Deploy software
* Orchestrate complex IT tasks (multi-machine workflows)

---

**✅ Why Use Ansible?**

* Agentless (no software needed on managed nodes)
* Uses simple YAML files (called playbooks)
* SSH-based, secure and easy
* Scales from one server to thousands

---

**🚀 How Ansible Works (Basic Flow)**

1. You write instructions in YAML (`.yml`) files.
2. Ansible connects to your remote servers via SSH.
3. It executes tasks in the order you define.

---

**🔧 Basic Setup**

**1. 📆 Install Ansible**

**Ubuntu:**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible -y
```

**RHEL/CentOS:**

```bash
sudo yum install epel-release -y
sudo yum install ansible -y
```

**2. 🧑‍💻 Create an Inventory File**

Example (`hosts.ini`):

```ini
[webservers]
192.168.1.10
192.168.1.11

[dbservers]
db1.example.com
```

**3. 🔑 Ensure SSH Works**

```bash
ssh-copy-id user@192.168.1.10
```

**4. 📜 Write a Simple Playbook**

Example (`hello.yml`):

```yaml
- name: Test connection
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Ping the server
      ansible.builtin.ping:
```

Run it:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini hello.yml
```

**📦 Example: Install Nginx**

```yaml
- name: Install Nginx
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
        update_cache: yes

    - name: Start nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
        enabled: yes
```
